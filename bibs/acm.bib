  abstract   = {Sentence Simplification (SS) aims to modify a sentence in order to make it easier to read and understand. In order to do so, several rewriting transformations can be performed such as replacement, reordering, and splitting. Executing these transformations while keeping sentences grammatical, preserving their main idea, and generating simpler output, is a challenging and still far from solved problem. In this article, we survey research on SS, focusing on approaches that attempt to learn how to simplify using corpora of aligned original-simplified sentence pairs in English, which is the dominant paradigm nowadays. We also include a benchmark of different approaches on common data sets so as to compare them and highlight their strengths and limitations. We expect that this survey will serve as a starting point for researchers interested in the task and help spark new ideas for future developments.},

  abstract  = {In the contemporary digital landscape, search engines play an invaluable role in information access, yet they often face challenges in Cross-Lingual Information Retrieval (CLIR). Though attempts are made to improve CLIR, current methods still leave users grappling with issues such as misplaced named entities and lost cultural context when querying in non-native languages. While some advances have been made using Neural Machine Translation models and cross-lingual representation, these are not without limitations. Enter the paradigm shift brought about by Large Language Models (LLMs), which have transformed search engines from simple retrievers to generators of contextually relevant information. This paper introduces the Multilingual Information Model for Intelligent Retrieval (MIMIR). Built on the power of LLMs, MIMIR directly responds in the language of the user's query, reducing the need for post-search translations. Our model's architecture encompasses a dual-module system: a retriever for searching multilingual documents and a responder for crafting answers in the user's desired language. Through a unique unified training framework, with the retriever serving as a reward model supervising the responder, and in turn, the responder producing synthetic data to refine the retriever's proficiency, MIMIR's retriever and responder iteratively enhance each other. Performance evaluations via CLEF and MKQA benchmarks reveal MIMIR's superiority over existing models, effectively addressing traditional CLIR challenges.},

  abstract  = {In today's digital age, accessing information across language barriers poses a significant challenge, with conventional search systems often struggling to interpret and retrieve multilingual content accurately. Addressing this issue, our study introduces a novel integration of applying Large Language Models (LLMs) as Cross-lingual Readers in information retrieval systems, specifically targeting the complexities of cross-lingual information retrieval (CLIR). We present an innovative approach: Activation Steered Multilingual Retrieval (ASMR) that employs "steering activations''-a method to adjust and direct the LLM's focus-enhancing its ability to understand user queries and generate accurate, language-coherent responses. ASMR adeptly combines a Multilingual Dense Passage Retrieval (mDPR) system with an LLM, overcoming the limitations of traditional search engines in handling diverse linguistic inputs. This approach is particularly effective in managing the nuances and intricacies inherent in various languages. Rigorous testing on established benchmarks such as XOR-TyDi QA, and MKQA demonstrates that ASMR not only meets but surpasses existing standards in CLIR, achieving state-of-the-art performance. The results of our research hold significant implications for understanding the inherent features of how LLMs understand and generate natural languages, offering an attempt towards more inclusive, effective, and linguistically diverse information access on a global scale.},

  abstract  = {Automatic Text Summarization (ATS) is a research area that originated in the late 1950s and has gained increasing importance with the surge of text data available today. ATS approaches are generally classified into extractive and abstractive methods. Extractive summarization selects the most relevant sentences from a text and copies them verbatim into the summary. Abstractive text summarization aims to generate a more cohesive and concise version of the original text. Recently, pre-trained and large language models such as BERT, BART, Pegasus, Llama, Gemma, and GPT-3 have revolutionized numerous natural language tasks, including creating more humanlike summaries. Despite the progress in recent years, there is room for improvement in directly comparing different summarization tools using a corpus containing high-quality reference summaries. This paper evaluates the quality of summaries generated by such tools, comparing the results obtained from abstractive and extractive summarization methods. Experiments were conducted using the CNN-corpus, focusing on news articles written in English and employing four evaluation measures. The experimental results unveiled that the Pegasus model outperformed others in abstractive summarization. These findings highlight the potential for further advancements in the field, suggesting that using more specialized models explicitly tailored for the summarization task may yield superior results compared to large general-purpose language models.},

  abstract  = {We are delighted to welcome you to Melbourne, Australia for ACM Multimedia 2024, the 32nd ACM International Conference on Multimedia. ACM Multimedia is the premier international conference series in the area of multimedia within the field of computer science. Since 1993, ACM Multimedia has been bringing together worldwide researchers and practitioners from academia and industry to present their innovative research and to discuss recent advancements in multimedia.For the first time since the end of the COVID-19 pandemic, this year's conference returns to the Asia-Pacific region and resumes as a full-fledged, inperson event. With no travel restrictions or significant visa challenges, we are excited to once again experience the warmth of face-to-face gatherings, where we can reconnect with colleagues and friends.The enthusiasm and support from the community have been incredible. ACM Multimedia 2024 received over 4,300 main conference submissions, accepting more than 1,100 papers (please refer to the TPC Chairs' message for details). In addition, 10 Grand Challenges were selected from 22 submissions, 18 workshops from 30 submissions, and 8 tutorials from 13 proposals. We've prepared an exciting five-day program: workshops, grand challenges, and tutorials will be held on the 1st and 5th days, with the main conference occupying the middle three days. All accepted papers will be accessible online prior to the conference, and we are working to ensure proceedings are available through the ACM Digital Library around the conference period.This year's conference features three distinguished academic keynote speeches, several prestigious SIGMM award talks, a panel discussion on Generative AI in Multimedia, a refreshed Brave New Idea (BNI) session, and our inaugural industry program.The opening keynote will be delivered by Prof. Pascale Fung from HKUST, a Fellow of AAAI, ACL, and IEEE. Her talk will explore the pressing topic of Agents in the Large Language Model (LLM) Era. Prof. Judy Kay from the University of Sydney, a renowned expert in HCI, user modeling, and ubiquitous computing, will give the second keynote on how to empower individuals to harness and control their multimodal data. The final academic keynote will be presented by Prof. Jiebo Luo from the University of Rochester, a Fellow of ACM, AAAI, IEEE, SPIE, and IAPR, as well as a member of Academia Europaea and the US National Academy of Inventors. He will discuss leveraging LLMs as social multimedia analysis engines.This year, we continue using OpenReview to ensure an open and transparent review process. Thanks to the exceptional efforts of the technical program committee, every paper received at least three reviews before the review announcement. The BNI track has also revamped its review process to align with the main conference, promoting visionary papers. Additionally, we are excited to introduce the industry program to ACM Multimedia for the first time, featuring industry keynote speeches, expert talks, and demonstrations (please refer to the industry chairs' message for further details).We are also committed to making the conference inclusive and accessible. To support students with financial constraints, we have awarded travel grants to at least 25 students from the ACM Multimedia 2024 budget, with an additional 20+ students receiving SIGMM travel grants.

  abstract  = {Large language models (LLMs) have taken centre stage in debates on Artificial Intelligence. Yet there remains a gap in how to assess LLMs' conformity to important human values. In this paper, we investigate whether state-of-the-art LLMs, GPT-4 and Claude 2.1 (Gemini Pro and LLAMA 2 did not generate valid results) are moral hypocrites. We employ two research instruments based on the Moral Foundations Theory: (i) the Moral Foundations Questionnaire (MFQ), which investigates which values are considered morally relevant in abstract moral judgements; and (ii) the Moral Foundations Vignettes (MFVs), which evaluate moral cognition in concrete scenarios related to each moral foundation. We characterise conflicts in values between these different abstractions of moral evaluation as hypocrisy. We found that both models displayed reasonable consistency within each instrument compared to humans, but they displayed contradictory and hypocritical behaviour when we compared the abstract values present in the MFQ to the evaluation of concrete moral violations of the MFV.},

  abstract  = {Automated Audio Captioning (AAC) focuses on producing detailed descriptions for a wide range of sounds, including those from nature and human activities. Recently, this field has garnered significant research attention, with the latest advancements in AAC systems largely driven by the use of sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) frameworks. These frameworks are increasingly powered by powerful models like Transformers, which have become the backbone of state-of-the-art AAC approaches. We propose an advanced Automated Audio Captioning (AAC) system that leverages the LLaMA3.1 decoder for robust language generation and the BEATs encoder for fine-grained acoustic feature extraction. These components are connected via a Q-Former intermediate layer, ensuring seamless audio-to-text alignment. To overcome the challenge of limited training data, we employ a sophisticated data augmentation strategy using Qwen&nbsp;, enhancing the model’s generalization and resilience. A multi-step training process with low-rank adaptation (LoRA) further optimizes performance. Our method obtains a 28.5 SPIDEr-FL score, outperforming the participates of DCASE 2023 Task 6A.Our code will be stored on GitHub1.},

Recognizing the breadth of this year's program, we are publishing two sets of proceedings: one dedicated to research track papers, the Web4Good track, and keynotes; and a companion proceedings featuring the Demo Paper Track, Short Paper Track, PhD Symposium, Special Day, Resource Track, and History of Web sessions. Through this rich assortment of activities, we aim to foster a vibrant community where delegates can share ideas, forge collaborations, and cultivate a sustainable, inclusive environment.Marking its 34th edition, WWW'25 welcomes more than 1,000 industry and academic experts eager to shape the future of Web technologies and applications. The conference logo, depicting the Sydney Harbour Bridge, symbolizes the Web's key function of "connecting" people and information. Originally founded at CERN in 1994 as the International World Wide Web Conference (WWW), this event has long been the leading venue for research, development, standards, and applications related to the Web.Over the years, WWW has introduced important breakthroughs, from The Anatomy of a Large-Scale Web Search Engine in 1998-which heralded Google-to the EigenTrust algorithm in 2003 and the YAGO knowledge base in 2007. In the period between 2024 and 2025, large language models (LLMs) have significantly influenced countless industries and everyday life, prompting fundamental shifts in the Web ecosystem. We anticipate that the research and discussions at this year's conference will spark further breakthroughs in this rapidly evolving field.Continuing the tradition of depth and diversity, WWW'25 accepted 26 workshops and 20 tutorials as pre-conference events. In addition, consistent with previous editions, we feature a Demo Paper Track, Short Paper Track, PhD Symposium, Special Day, Resource Track, History of Web sessions, and Artifact Badging. Some of these are incorporated into the main conference schedule to encourage communication and collaboration among attendees.A commitment to diversity is pivotal to fostering robust, sustainable Web technologies. Our Web4Good track highlights how Web-based tools can address societal challenges, while the Industry Track showcases novel and impactful results from the industrial sector. This year, we have also launched an Emerging World Track to broaden participation from developing countries, as well as a competition track to enhance industry engagement..Organizing WWW'25 has been a true team effort. We sincerely thank the authors who contributed their work, and we extend our gratitude to the program and senior program committees for their dedication to reviewing submissions and offering feedback. We also appreciate the many additional chairs whose efforts ensured that each element of the program ran smoothly. Together, they have helped this conference continue to grow into a premier event for the Web research community.Finally, we would like to thank ACM SIGWEB and our industry sponsors-Meta, Huawei, Google, Baidu, Taobao, JD, and Infinigence-for their generous support, as well as our local government sponsors, Business Event Sydney and the NSW Government. We are equally grateful to our academic partner, the University of Technology Sydney, and the PCO company, ICMSA, for their indispensable help with registration, venue logistics, and social events.

AAMAS is the flagship conference of the non-profit International Foundation for Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems (IFAAMAS).We are happy that the 2025 edition of AAMAS will be coming to Detroit, MI. Previous editions were held in Bologna (2002), Melbourne (2003), New York (2004), Utrecht (2005), Hakodate (2006), Honolulu (2007), Estoril (2008), Budapest (2009), Toronto (2010), Taipei (2011), Valencia (2012), Saint Paul (2013), Paris (2014), Istanbul (2015), Singapore (2016), S\~{a}o Paulo (2017), Stockholm (2018), Montr\'{e}al (2019), Auckland/online (2020), London/online (2021), Auckland/online (2022), London (2023), and Auckland (2024).The main track of the conference includes peer-reviewed technical papers describing significant and original research on all aspects of the theory and practice of autonomous agents and multiagent systems, divided into the following areas of interest:Learning and Adaptation (LEARN)Game Theory and Economic Paradigms (GTEP)Coordination, Organizations, Institutions, Norms, and Ethics (COINE)Search, Optimization, Planning, and Scheduling (SOPS)Representation, Perception, and Reasoning (RPR)Engineering and Analysis of Multiagent Systems (EMAS)Modeling and Simulation of Societies (SIM)Human-Agent Interaction (HAI)Robotics and Control (ROBOT)Innovative Applications (IA)As in previous years, we worked with a three-tier program committee, consisting of 29 area chairs, 147 senior program committee members, and over 600 regular program committee members. Their work was supported by a substantial number of auxiliary reviewers. When composing the committee, we followed the tradition of AAMAS of not having anyone serve in a senior programme committee or area chair role for more than two years in a row, and we were pleased to see that many senior colleagues accepted our invitation to serve as regular programme committee members.For the main track, we received a total of 1361 abstract submissions. Some didn't materialize while a number of others were desk-rejected (mostly due to anonymity violations and similar infringements of the rules laid down in the Call for Papers). The program committee then reviewed the remaining 1021 submissions. Almost all submissions received at least three reviews, as well as a meta-review summarizing the assessment of the program committee. Authors had the opportunity to respond to initial versions of their reviews during a rebuttal phase, and the rebuttal phase additional gave the authors and reviewers an opportunity to engage in further discussion.},

This conference focuses on multimedia information retrieval with a wide spectrum of topics ranging from multimedia/multimodal content understanding and learning, multimedia/multimodal information search and retrieval, multimedia/multimodal data security and processing, all the way to analysis and understanding of community-contributed social data, lifelogging data and automatically generated sensor data, integration of diverse multimodal data, and deep learning-based methodology and practical multimedia applications.For the conference regular program, we have received a record-breaking number of 515 submissions to the full paper track and another 81 submissions to the short paper track. The submissions were from all over the world. The program committee, led by the program chairs, has done a fabulous job in managing the reviewing process. Each submission received at least 2 independent reviews. In the borderline cases, additional reviews were sought in order to reach a fair decision. After a rigorous review process, we have accepted 211 long papers, resulting in an acceptance rate of 41\%, and 35 short papers as posters with 43\% acceptance rate. We would like to send our warm congratulations to the authors of all the accepted papers and thank the program committee members and reviewers who help evaluate the submissions. The regular program of the conference consists of oral presentations of the full papers and spotlight presentations of the short papers together with the poster presentations.In addition to the regular program, the conference also has a wide variety of other technical and social events. The technical program includes the new brave ideas session selected from all the submissions that are considered to have new and brave ideas, a panel discussion that focuses on a hot topic with perspectives from a group of leaders in this community, and a session for reproducibility where accepted papers and demos are presented with the focus on the principle and consensus of transparency, repeatability, and rigorous validation of multimedia research. Of course, the regular program offers keynote speeches from well-known leaders to provide their insight and inspiration to the audience.On the first day of the conference, before the regular program begins, we have two tutorials and four workshops covering a diverse range of topics related to multimedia retrieval and search.The social events of this conference include a welcome reception open to all the conference attendees, a gala dinner in a night of the conference with a cruise on the Chicago River at the downtown of Chicago in which we shall announce the winners of the best paper award and the best student paper award, and the exhibition booths open to all the attendees from leading industrial partners and publishers.},

  abstract  = {We present WebFAQ, a large-scale collection of open-domain question answering datasets derived from FAQ-style schema.org annotations. In total, the data collection consists of 96 million natural question-answer (QA) pairs across 75 languages, including 47 million (49\%) non-English samples. WebFAQ further serves as the foundation for 49 monolingual retrieval benchmarks with a total size of 11.2 million QA pairs (5.9 million non-English). These datasets are carefully curated through refined filtering and near-duplicate detection, yielding high-quality resources for training and evaluating multilingual dense retrieval models. To empirically confirm WebFAQ's efficacy, we use the collected QAs to fine-tune an in-domain pretrained XLM-RoBERTa model. Through this process of dataset-specific fine-tuning, the model achieves significant retrieval performance gains, which generalize - beyond WebFAQ - to other multilingual retrieval benchmarks evaluated in zero-shot setting. Last but not least, we utilize WebFAQ to construct a set of QA-aligned bilingual corpora spanning over 1000 language pairs using state-of-the-art bitext mining and automated LLM-assessed translation evaluation. Due to our advanced, automated method of bitext dataset generation, the resulting bilingual corpora demonstrate higher translation quality compared to similar datasets. WebFAQ and all associated resources are publicly available on GitHub and HuggingFace.},

We believe that holding the conference in person offers significant advantages, including richer opportunities for direct engagement and networking, a more dynamic exchange of research ideas, and a more welcoming environment for newcomers. To accommodate those who, in exceptional cases, are unable to attend in person, we have arranged for the option of proxy presenters (i.e. a qualified person presents on their behalf).This year's conference spans six days, beginning with a day dedicated to the Doctoral Consortium and Tutorial presentations. The following three days feature sessions comprising three Keynote Talks, full papers, short papers, resource and reproducibility papers, perspective papers, lowresources environments papers, system demonstrations, and an industry track (SIRIP). The program also features two Women in IR (WIR) activities (a panel and a poster session). Finally, the last day is devoted to Workshops aimed at fostering discussion and encouraging collaboration on emerging research topics in Information Retrieval, as well as to the LiveRag challenge, organized by the Technology Innovation Institute, and focused on Retrieval Augmented Generation. On Friday the 18th the ICTIR 2025 Conference takes place.Social highlights include a welcome reception, a conference dinner, a student luncheon and student party, as well as the WIR reception and the ICTIR Social Dinner.The SIGIR 2025 technical program is highlighted by three keynote presentations delivered by esteemed speakers, to whom we extend our sincere gratitude: Stephen Robertson (Girton College, Cambridge, UK), Iryna Gurevych (Technical University of Darmstadt, Germany), and Ophir Frieder (Georgetown University, Washington DC, USA).},

  abstract  = {Welcome to ACM ICTIR 2025, the 11th ACM SIGIR / the 15th International Conference on Innovative Concepts and Theories in Information Retrieval. ICTIR went through a number of major developments in 2025 that are briefly described below.A new chapter in the history of ICTIR: Ten years ago, ICTIR 2015 was established under the ACM SIGIR umbrella as the premier forum for presenting and discussing research on theoretical and foundational aspects of Information Retrieval. Given the evolving nature of the Information Retrieval field and the needs of the SIGIR community and the conference, ACM ICTIR, formerly known as the "ACM SIGIR International Conference on the Theory of Information Retrieval", is renamed to ACM SIGIR International Conference on Innovative Concepts and Theories in Information Retrieval.This new branding highlights and clarifies the focus of the conference for the authors, the reviewers, and the organizers. The conference aims to provide a forum for the presentation and discussion of research related to the foundational aspects of Information Retrieval (IR), including, for example, new or improved models of relevance, ranking, representation, information needs, and evaluation. The conference also welcomes interdisciplinary research that connects information retrieval with other research disciplines that are theoretically motivated. We use the definition of foundation used by ICTIR founders as a scientific result that others can build upon and use for their own research. While IR research traditionally relies heavily on rigorous experimentation, ICTIR does not see this as a must.SIGIR Revise-and-Resubmit for ICTIR: For the first time, ICTIR 2025 accepts two types of submissions: regular submissions and SIGIR Revise-and-Resubmit (SIGIR-RR) submissions. SIGIRRR submissions are for revised manuscripts of papers that were submitted to but not accepted by the SIGIR 2025 conference (only full and short paper tracks). Authors can use this option to address the issues raised in the SIGIR 2025 reviews and revise the paper accordingly.Special Theme: Even though ICTIR 2025 welcomes papers on all areas of Information Retrieval as detailed above, its program especially welcomes research papers related to the following theme: "LLMs + IR, what could possibly go wrong?" This theme stands on the long-term relationship between large language models and information retrieval. In order to foster a lively discussion on this theme, we seek innovative and foundational technical research papers and discussion papers that methodologically studies this theme by providing impactful perspectives, opinions, or positions on the matter.},

  abstract  = {Toxicity detection in gaming communities faces significant scaling challenges when expanding across multiple games and languages, particularly in real-time environments where computational efficiency is crucial. We present two key findings to address these challenges while building upon our previous work on ToxBuster, a BERT-based real-time toxicity detection system. First, we introduce a soft-prompting approach that enables a single model to effectively handle multiple games by incorporating game-context tokens, matching the performance of more complex methods like curriculum learning while offering superior scalability. Second, we develop an LLM-assisted label transfer framework using GPT-4o-mini to extend support to seven additional languages. Evaluations on real game chat data across French, German, Portuguese, and Russian achieve macro F1-scores ranging from 32.96\% to 58.88\%, with particularly strong performance in German, surpassing the English benchmark of 45.39\%. In production, this unified approach significantly reduces computational resources and maintenance overhead compared to maintaining separate models for each game and language combination. At Ubisoft, this model successfully identifies an average of 50 players, per game, per day engaging in sanctionable behavior.},
